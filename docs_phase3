Phase 1 Feedback:

Target Groups, Benefits, and Technology:
I have adjusted the conceptual overview to clearly show that the target groups, benefits, and technologies have been considered.

Filename:
The filename has been adjusted according to section 4 of the course assignment.

Architecture Diagram:
The architecture diagram has been revised, and I switched to the C4 model instead of UML. Additionally, the blocks 'input' and 'game logic' have been removed from the diagram, as they are not building blocks in a container diagram.


Phase 2 Feedback:

Gimp in Technology Decisions:
Gimp has been removed from the technology decisions, as it is not a relevant technology for the application.

Test Cases and Data:
I will still add test cases and data, and I plan to formulate them as actions with expected results.

Installation Instructions:
I will add the installation instructions to the README file at a later stage.

Responsiveness:
The key classes/modules in the Snake game have been rewritten to adapt responsively to the window size with the canvas.

GitHub Code Submission:
I will ensure that the code is uploaded to GitHub so feedback can be provided.
