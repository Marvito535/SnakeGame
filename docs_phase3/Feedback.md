c# Feedback Document for Project

## Feedback from Phase 1

1. **Target Groups, Benefits, and Technology**:
   - I ensured that the target groups, benefits, and technology were clearly considered in the conceptual overview.

2. **Filename**:
   - The filename has been updated according to section 4 of the course assignment.

3. **Architecture Diagram**:
   - I have adjusted the architecture based on the feedback and now use the C4 model instead of UML. The components that were previously incorrect (like JavaScript and Canvas) were removed.

## Feedback from Phase 2

1. **Architecture Diagram**:
   - I removed the blocks "input" and "game logic" from the container diagram, as they are not building blocks.

2. **Gimp**:
   - Gimp was removed from the technology choices as it is not a technology.

3. **Test Cases and Data**:
   - I have not yet provided the test cases and data but will address this later.

## Additional Information

- **Responsive Design**: The main classes/modules of the Snake game were rewritten to make it responsive, adapting to the window size with the canvas.
- **Missing Code on GitHub**: I understand that my code was not uploaded to GitHub, and I will address this shortly.
- **Installation Instructions**: I will add the installation instructions to the README file in the coming days.
